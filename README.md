# Wave ![DECOMPILED](https://img.shields.io/badge/DECOMPILED-green)
This repository contains the decompiled files for Wave, a roblox executor. The only file that has been decompiled is `Wave.exe`.

If you have any questions - email [hello@infatom.site](mailto:hello@infatom.site) or chat with me on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/infinity-atom)

## How did I do this?
I have used [JetBrains dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) to decompile this application which uses C#.NET. I have gotten the download link from https://getwave.gg/ and used [this working tutorial (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OBdN3JpPpo) to get past the virus detection.

## Why did I do this?
Many people on [r/robloxhackers](https://reddit.com/r/robloxhackers) debate on if Wave is malware. I have decompiled this app so others can scan through the code themselves to find malicious code.
